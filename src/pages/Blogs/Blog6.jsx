      <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        In today’s fast-paced business environment, automating repetitive tasks is no longer a luxury — it’s
        a necessity. Whether you're in HR, IT, marketing, or operations, finding ways to improve efficiency
        and eliminate manual work can save valuable time and reduce errors. That's where Microsoft Power
        Automate comes in.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">What is Power Automate?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Microsoft Power Automate is a cloud-based service that helps users create automated workflows between
        various apps and services. Formerly known as Microsoft Flow, Power Automate allows you to connect your
        favorite tools like Outlook, SharePoint, Excel, Teams, Twitter, and more — without writing a single
        line of code.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Why Should Beginners Use Power Automate?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Power Automate is designed with ease-of-use in mind. With a drag-and-drop interface, pre-built
        templates, and step-by-step guides, beginners can quickly build powerful automations. You don’t need
        to be a developer — just have a clear understanding of your workflow and goals.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Common Use Cases</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li><strong>Email Notifications:</strong> Get alerts when someone fills out a form or submits a document.</li>
        <li><strong>File Management:</strong> Automatically save email attachments to OneDrive or SharePoint.</li>
        <li><strong>Approvals:</strong> Automate leave request approvals or document reviews with a simple click.</li>
        <li><strong>Social Media:</strong> Schedule posts or monitor mentions automatically.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Sync:</strong> Update entries across multiple Excel files or databases simultaneously.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Understanding the Basics: Triggers and Actions</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Power Automate workflows are made up of:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li><strong>Triggers:</strong> These are events that start a flow (e.g., "When a new email arrives").</li>
        <li><strong>Actions:</strong> The steps that follow (e.g., "Save attachment to OneDrive").</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-4">
        With hundreds of connectors available — including Microsoft 365, Google Drive, Slack, Trello, and
        Salesforce — you can easily integrate apps you already use.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Step-by-Step Example: Automate Email to SharePoint</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Let’s say you receive weekly reports via email and want them automatically saved to SharePoint. Here’s
        how:
      </p>
      <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>Log into Power Automate (flow.microsoft.com).</li>
        <li>Select <strong>+ Create</strong> and choose "Automated cloud flow."</li>
        <li>Name the flow and set the trigger to "When a new email arrives."</li>
        <li>Add a condition to filter emails by subject or sender.</li>
        <li>Add an action: "Create file in SharePoint."</li>
        <li>Test the flow by sending a sample email. Done!</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Tips for Success</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>Start with templates — they save time and offer ideas.</li>
        <li>Test flows thoroughly before deploying them in production.</li>
        <li>Use naming conventions for easier maintenance.</li>
        <li>Enable flow history to troubleshoot errors easily.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">When to Upgrade to Premium</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        While many features are free with a Microsoft 365 subscription, some connectors (like Salesforce or
        Dataverse) and premium features (like RPA and AI builder) require additional licensing. For advanced
        business process automation, upgrading might be worth it.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">The Future of Automation</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Automation is reshaping how businesses operate. With low-code platforms like Power Automate, even
        non-technical users can design solutions that reduce costs, improve accuracy, and free up time for
        strategic tasks.
