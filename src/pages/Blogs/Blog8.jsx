      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">1. AI-Powered Personalization</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Artificial Intelligence is now at the core of digital campaigns. From personalized product
        recommendations to predictive customer behavior, AI is enabling marketers to serve the right message to
        the right person at the right time. Tools like ChatGPT, Jasper AI, and dynamic landing pages are driving
        conversion rates higher than ever.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">2. Short-Form Video Content</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts continue to dominate engagement. In 2024,
        brands that create authentic, entertaining, and informative short videos are seeing exponential organic
        growth. Quick tutorials, product unboxing, and user-generated content perform exceptionally well.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">3. Influencer Collaboration Over Celebrity Endorsement</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Micro and nano influencers now deliver better ROI than big-name celebrities. Their niche audiences trust
        their recommendations more. In 2024, businesses are focusing on long-term influencer partnerships over
        one-time paid promotions.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">4. SEO for Voice & Visual Search</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        With smart speakers and image-based search growing, optimizing for voice queries (natural language) and
        visual content (alt text, structured data) is key. 2024 SEO strategies go beyond keywords — it’s about
        context, clarity, and multi-modal content.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">5. First-Party Data is King</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        With the decline of third-party cookies and rising privacy regulations, collecting first-party data
        through newsletters, gated content, and interactive tools (quizzes, surveys) is essential. Email
        marketing is making a huge comeback thanks to personalized, behavior-based flows.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">6. Interactive & Immersive Content</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Quizzes, polls, AR filters, and 360-degree product views increase time-on-site and engagement. Consumers
        want experiences, not just content. Brands are blending design with storytelling to keep users clicking,
        scrolling, and exploring.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">7. Automation & Chatbots</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        From automated email workflows to chatbot-based customer service, automation saves time and increases
        efficiency. In 2024, smart automation is not just a tool — it’s a competitive edge.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">8. Ethical Branding & Transparency</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Consumers now care more about brand values, sustainability, and how companies treat their employees.
        Authentic storytelling, behind-the-scenes content, and clear communication about policies build trust
        and loyalty in the digital space.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Conclusion</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The digital marketing landscape in 2024 is fast-paced, data-driven, and centered on building genuine
        customer relationships. From AI tools and automation to video content and ethical branding, success lies
        in adapting and innovating. Test strategies, track results, and stay flexible — because in digital, the
        only constant is change.
