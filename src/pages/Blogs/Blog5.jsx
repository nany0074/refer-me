      <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        In today’s rapidly transforming digital economy, the role of a Business Analyst (BA) has become more
        critical than ever. From bridging the gap between stakeholders and technical teams to enabling digital
        innovation, business analysts play a pivotal role in helping companies thrive. However, as
        organizations increasingly adopt technologies like AI, cloud computing, and data analytics, the skill
        set required for business analysts has evolved dramatically.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">What is Digital Business Analysis?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Digital business analysis goes beyond traditional requirements gathering. It includes strategic
        thinking, innovation facilitation, and the ability to work with agile and data-driven frameworks. The
        modern BA doesn’t just define requirements—they shape digital transformation journeys and deliver
        customer-centric solutions.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Why Traditional BA Skills Aren’t Enough</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        While skills like stakeholder communication, documentation, and process mapping remain important,
        today’s BAs must go further. They are expected to understand complex digital systems, navigate rapid
        change, and contribute directly to product strategy.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Businesses now look to analysts not just for requirement specs, but for guidance on automation,
        customer journeys, and platform integration.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Top Essential Skills for Business Analysts in the Digital Age</h2>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-4 mb-2">1. Digital Literacy</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        A modern BA must understand how technology impacts business models. Familiarity with cloud services
        (AWS, Azure), mobile platforms, AI, and data analytics tools is essential. While deep tech expertise
        isn’t required, the ability to collaborate with technical teams is crucial.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-4 mb-2">2. Agile and Lean Methodologies</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Agile practices like Scrum and Kanban dominate modern project delivery. A BA must adapt to
        incremental development, user stories, sprints, and MVPs. Lean thinking, focused on customer value
        and waste elimination, is also a key mindset in today’s fast-moving environments.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-4 mb-2">3. Data-Driven Decision Making</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        BAs are increasingly expected to analyze and interpret data to inform product development and business
        strategy. Familiarity with tools like Excel, Power BI, Google Analytics, and SQL can significantly
        enhance a BA’s impact.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-4 mb-2">4. UX and Customer Journey Mapping</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Understanding user behavior and designing for the end-user are now vital parts of a BA’s role.
        Wireframing tools like Figma or Balsamiq and techniques like empathy maps or service blueprints help
        BAs align digital solutions with real customer needs.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-4 mb-2">5. Strategic Thinking</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Today’s BAs must think beyond features and functions. They must assess how proposed solutions align
        with business goals, industry trends, and competitive positioning. Strategic vision combined with
        analytical detail is a powerful combination.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-4 mb-2">6. Change Management</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Digital transformation impacts people, processes, and culture. BAs must support change initiatives by
        understanding organizational behavior, stakeholder resistance, and communication planning.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-4 mb-2">7. Soft Skills & Emotional Intelligence</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Collaboration, negotiation, and active listening are more important than ever. In virtual and
        cross-functional teams, emotional intelligence helps BAs navigate conflict, build trust, and foster
        innovation.
      </p>
